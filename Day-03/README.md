# Day 3 – LeetCode Practice

Today I solved two LeetCode problems focusing on **linked lists** and **basic problem-solving patterns**.

## Problem 1: Remove Duplicates from Sorted List (Easy)

Since the linked list is already sorted, duplicate values appear next to each other.  
I used a single pointer to traverse the list and skipped nodes whenever a duplicate was found.

This helped me understand how **pointer manipulation** works in linked lists without using extra space.

## Problem 2: Maximum Square Area by Removing Fences From a Field (Medium)

In this problem, the key idea was realizing that a square can only be formed when the distance between two horizontal fences matches the distance between two vertical fences.

I computed all possible distances between fences and selected the largest common one to get the maximum square area.

This problem improved my understanding of:
- Using **sets** for efficient lookup
- Translating a geometric problem into a **distance-based logic**

## What I Learned Today
- How sorted properties can simplify linked list problems
- Importance of breaking a problem into smaller logical steps
- Using mathematical observations to reduce complex geometry problems

Consistency over speed — solved, learned, and committed.
