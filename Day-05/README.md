# Day 5 – LeetCode Practice

Today I solved two problems that focused on **array manipulation** and **pattern recognition**.

---

## Problem 1: Largest Magic Square (Medium)

This problem helped me understand how to efficiently check multiple subgrids inside a matrix.  
By using prefix sums, I was able to calculate row and column sums quickly instead of recalculating them every time.

I learned how combining **brute force with optimization** can make even complex-looking problems manageable.

## Problem 2: Merge Sorted Array (Easy)

This problem reinforced the idea of solving in-place array problems by working **from the end**.  
Using three pointers helped me merge two sorted arrays without using extra space or shifting elements.

It was a good reminder that sometimes the **direction of traversal** is the key insight.

## What I Learned Today
- Prefix sums can significantly reduce repeated calculations
- In-place array problems often become easier when processed backward
- Small insights can lead to optimal `O(n)` solutions

Solved, learned, and committed.
