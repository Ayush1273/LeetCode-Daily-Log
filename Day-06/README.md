# Day 6 – LeetCode Practice

Today I focused on **matrix-based problems** and **tree traversal**, which helped reinforce both optimization techniques and core data structure concepts.

---

## Problem 1: Maximum Side Length of a Square with Sum ≤ Threshold (Medium)

This problem taught me how powerful **2D prefix sums** can be when working with matrices.  
Instead of recalculating sums repeatedly, prefix sums allowed me to check square sums efficiently and grow the square size greedily.

It strengthened my understanding of optimizing brute-force approaches using preprocessing.

## Problem 2: Binary Tree Inorder Traversal (Easy)

Here, I practiced the **iterative inorder traversal** using a stack.  
Although recursion is simpler, the iterative approach helped me understand how recursion works internally and why stacks are so important in tree problems.

## What I Learned Today
- Prefix sums make repeated matrix sum queries very efficient
- Stack-based tree traversal is essential for interviews
- Optimization often comes from choosing the right data structure

Consistent practice and steady progress.
